> Community driven media cleanup

![byedarr](.github/header.png)

## What is it?

**byedarr** is an application which cleans up your media library over time, letting your users vote on which items to keep or to remove.

## How does it work?

1. Connect to your media managers (sonarr/radarr)
2. Connect to your Discord server
3. The bot determines which items to remove, and posts messages to the selected channel:
   ![byedarr](.github/discord1.png)
4. After a set time the voting will conclude and the bot will either add the item to a whitelist, or flag it for deletion
5. After the grace period the item will be removed

## Setup

1. Create a Discord bot and get the **bot** token: https://discord.com/developers/applications

2. Create a `.env` file with the following:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your token>
```

3. Create a `config.yml` file

```yml
mediaManagers:
  - id: "radarr"
    enabled: true
    type: "radarr"
    apiUrl: "http://radarr:7878/radarr"
    apiKey: "xxx"
  - id: "sonarr"
    enabled: true
    type: "sonarr"
    apiUrl: "http://sonarr:8989/sonarr"
    apiKey: "xxx"
votingPeriod: "1 week"
gracePeriod: "1 week"
immunityPeriod: "3 months"
discord:
  channelId: "123456" # Enable Discord developer mode and right-click the channel then press "Copy Channel ID"
```

4. `docker-compose.yml`

```yml
services:
  byedarr:
    image: ghcr.io/benjick/byedarr:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
      - CONFIG_PATH=/config/config.yml
    volumes:
      - ./config.yml:/config/config.yml
    restart: unless-stopped

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

> âœ‹ The config is read on app start, so any changes will require a restart.
